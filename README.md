# CollectFour

  Created a multi-threaded online game called collect four which allowed users to connect to the
server by giving its ip address as a client. Then they could register or log in to the system with the
usage of mySQL database. After that users could create a lobby choosing the size of the lobby
between 4-10 and set a password to the lobby if they want to, meanwhile other users can list and join
to the lobbies that these users create. After the set amount of players have joined to a lobby the game
would start and distribute random number decks to the players, where at each turn players must
choose a number to discard from their deck and wait for other players to choose. After everyone
discards a number they are shuffled and sent to back to the players. If a player has the same number
filled inside their deck they would type in bingo to get points and allow others to type in bingo as well
which results in the ones typing faster to get more points. Lobbies can play the game concurrently
without interrupting each other.
